# DunderMifflin

Welcome to Dunder Mifflin Paper Company! This gem was created for my very first Flatiron School Phase 1 project. I developed this gem to help office fans view quotes from the tv show. This gem allows the user to view a list of quotes from the show and find the character that said the quote.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'Dunder_Mifflin'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install Dunder_Mifflin

## Usage

Execute the bin file bin/run and  You will be prompted with the option to select 1 to list quotes or the option to exit the program. Once you select the list quotes option, You can select a quote number to view further details on the quote which will reveal the character who said the line from the Tv-Show.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
